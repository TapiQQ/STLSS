TLS server demo for Master's Thesis

This project served as a practice for my following project for my thesis.

In this project, i build a dummy TLS server (Simple TLS Server) that is able to save TLS sessions externally to share them with other processes/machines.

This technology was utilized in a project done for my thesis: https://github.com/TapiQQ/ngtcp2_scache
